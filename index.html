    <h1>Dear Dad,</h1>
    <p>I am typing this because I love you, througout my entire life, through my ups & my downs, no matter how good or horrible I was, you were there for me. You always lightened the mood, no matter the situation, you were always in my corner, and because of that I will always love you no matter what, just like how you loved me no matter what. And regardless of any disagreements or fights between us...<br></p>
    <h3>You'll always be my dad, and the best one I could ever ask for.</h3>
